    "# Sentinel-2 Water Extraction\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is the extraction of water polygons from Sentinel-2 imagery. This was developed to provide support in flooding events.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## MVP\n",
    "This has been developed rapidly and is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP). There is much opportunity for further development. See the end of this document for some possible improvements.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Selecting the Imagery\n",
    "It is recommended to use [Sentinel-hub](https://apps.sentinel-hub.com/eo-browser/) to find imagery that meets your requirements for extracting water.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have found the imagery you want to extract water polygons from, the below documentation will take you through each step to target the imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Outputs\n",
    "The main outputs of this notebook are:\n",
    "* Polygons delineating water (.shp)\n",
    "* The imagery fetched and used to extract water (.TIFF)\n",
    "\n",
    "All outputs are written to the user defined `output_directory`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "### MNDWI\n",
    "For the purpose of delineating water, the MNDWI (modified Normalized Difference Water Index) is employed. This indicates water by using the ratio of the difference in the Green and Shortwave Infrared (SWIR) reflectance. This calculation leverages the properties of water that sees high amounts of visible light reflected while absorbing SWIR energy (see the MNDWI formular below).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![MNDWI Formular](images/mndwi.png \"MNDWI Formular\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### COGs\n",
    "This Notebook uses Sentinel-2 data as stored in the Cloud Optimsed GeoTIFF (COG) format. One of the advantages of the COG format is the ability to make range requests whereby just a subset of data within an image is fetched.\n",
    "\n",
    "This concept is transformational when working with satellite imagery. Rather than downloading large images such as the Sentinel-2 100km X 100km granule at approximately 1GB, just the proportion of the image needed can be requested. This practice greatly reduces inefficiencies in data transfer, data processing and data management.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  STAC\n",
    "The [STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog)](https://github.com/radiantearth/stac-api-spec) API is queried to fetch references to the Sentinel-2 COGs that meet our needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Use\n",
    "The below python libraries are central to the process\n",
    "\n",
    "* **rasterio:** For displaying and writing the COG images\n",
    "* **rio_tiler:** For requesting and reading the image data. This provides the functionality for mapping the users area of interest (bounding box) to the images pixels for the range requests.\n",
    "* **satsearch:** For querying the image store STAC metadata to filter for images that meet the specified criteria (e.g. date and geospatial extent)\n",
    "* **matplotlib:** For plotting imagery\n",
    "* **geopandas:** Supports the handling of the vector data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations\n",
    "While this process will allow for the extraction of water polygons from Sentinel-2 imagery with very little effort, it must be noted results will not be perfect. This is due to limitations of Water Indices, atmospheric affects, the size of water features and strength of the water's signature captured.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even with such limitations, this method is light-weight and much quicker than relying on laborious manual capture. Manual QA and improvements can be performed on the results fairly rapidly once in a GIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "Possible defects to be-aware of include:\n",
    "* **Cloud:** Cloud will have a negative impact on the water extraction results. This includes cloud cover inhibiting water detection and cloud returning false positives. In the ideal world, imagery would be cloud free.\n",
    "* **Small water features not captured**  Sentinel-2 pixel resolution is 10m. This combined with (mixed pixel)[https://en.mimi.hu/gis/mixed_pixel.html] causes small water features to not be extracted.\n",
    "* **Snow**: the MNDWI will return false positives for snow.\n"
